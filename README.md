# SPA Travel Landing Page

This is a tutorial project that I made to better understand how to use the Nest Js framework, how folders are organized, what I can and cannot delete, etc. I took the liberty of improving some specific points that I felt were missing in the original version, such as some responsive sizes, for example.
## Stack used
Next JS, Resct Js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS
